# Chess Engine
A Chess Engine made in Java.

# TODO for later
- Issue when Pawn checks King
    - Only King can capture pawn
    - All other pieces unable to capture pawn/move
    - Problem persists for both sides

- Fix Pawn promotion
    - Aim for better GUI during promotion
    - Exiting out of promotion, removes the Pawn from play
        - Maybe do a force promotion (Auto select queen if exited)
